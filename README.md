# AI-Customer-Review-Emotion-Analyzer

# Overview

This project implements a Deep Learning-based Emotion Classification System using a Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) architecture.

The system analyzes textual data such as customer reviews and predicts the underlying emotion expressed in the text. It demonstrates practical applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sequence modeling using deep learning.


# Problem Statement

Understanding customer emotions from textual feedback is essential for businesses. Manual review analysis is inefficient and time-consuming.

This project aims to:
- Automatically classify emotions from text
- Provide real-time predictions
- Demonstrate deployment of a trained deep learning model


# Model Architecture

- Text preprocessing (tokenization, padding, stemming)
- Embedding Layer
- Bidirectional LSTM
- Dense Layers
- Softmax Output Layer

BiLSTM captures context from both forward and backward directions, improving prediction performance.


# Model Performance

- Training Accuracy: ~97%
- Validation Accuracy: ~87%
- Early Stopping applied to prevent overfitting
